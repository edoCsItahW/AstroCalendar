Abstract:
    The aim of this study is to develop new analytical series representing
    lunar coordinates to accuracy compatible with the accuracy of the
    modern numerical ephemeris of the Moon.

Description:
  The files contain numerical coefficients of the Poisson series representing
  the geocentric ecliptic spherical coordinates of the Moon R, V and U where
    R is the geocentric distance,
    V is the spherical longitude,
    U is the spherical latitude.
  The series are obtained by spectral analysis of the long-term numerical
  ephemeris of the Moon LE-405/406 (Standish 1998: JPL IOM 312.F-98-048).

  There are two versions of the Poisson series for lunar coordinates R, V, U:
  - the complete series, LEA-406a, include 42270 terms of minimal
    amplitude equivalent to 1 cm and are valid over 1500-2500.
  - the simplified series, LEA-406b, include 7952 terms of minimal
    amplitude equivalent to 1 m and are valid over 3000BC-3000AD.

  The formulation of the series is:
      R = {SUM}[k=1,Records;i=0,2](A_ki_*t^i^*cos(Arg_ki_))
      V = V0(t) + {SUM}[k=1,Records;i=0,2](A_ki_*t^i^*sin(Arg_ki_))
      U = {SUM}[k=1,Records;i=0,2](A_ki_*t^i^*sin(Arg_ki_))

  where

  t is the time (TDB) in thousands of Julian years from J2000:
      t=(JulianDate-2451545.0)/365250.0;

  V0(t) is the mean longitude of the Moon referred to the moving ecliptic and
     mean equinox of date as given by Simon et al. (1994A&A..282..663S)
     [or use Eq.(37) of the paper];

  A_ki_ is the amplitude of the "k"th Poisson term of the order i;

  Arg_ki_ is the four-degree time polynomial argument defined as linear
     combination of integer multipliers of 14 variables (Arg_j_, j=1,14):
     Delaunay variables l, l', F, D;
     mean longitude of the ascending node of the Moon {Omega};
     mean longitudes of eight major planets {lambda}_pl_;
     and the general precession in longitude p_A_.
     So that Arg_ki_={SUM}[j=1,14](m_kj_*Arg_j_+phi_ki_),
     where m_kj_ are the integer multiplies and phi_ki_ are the phases.
     The expressions for Arg_j_ are given by Simon et al. (1994A&A..282..663S)
     [or use Eq.(38)-(51) of the paper].

    The lunar coordinates R, V and U given by the series are referred to
    the moving ecliptic and mean equinox of date. Transformation of the
    coordinates to the reference frame of the numerical ephemeris
    LE-405/406 (defined by the mean geoequator and equinox of epoch J2000)
    should be performed with use of the precession quantities as given by
    Simon et al. (1994A&A..282..663S) [or use Eq.(52)-(55) of the paper].

    A Fortran 77 subroutine for calculation of lunar rectangular
    coordinates on the base of the suggested Poisson series and two test
    examples are also given.
